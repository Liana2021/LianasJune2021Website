I am a Māori (Ngāti Kuia, Rangitāne o Wairau, Ngāti Koata) scholar who draws from sociological and philosophical perspectives to enable decolonial transformation in education. My research interests include: 1) settler colonialism and structural racism in schools, 2) land education to redefine race relations, and 3) curriculum development through school-iwi partnerships.

I was a secondary school English and Social Studies teacher for 11 years and am currently a Lecturer in the Faculty of Education at Victoria University of Wellington. Before I was a postdoctoral research fellow for a Marsden project: *He Taonga te Wareware: Remembering and Forgetting New Zealand’s Colonial Past*.
