I am a Māori scholar (Ngāti Kuia, Rangitāne o Wairau, Ngāti Koata) lecturer at the School of Education at Victoria University of Wellington. I draw from sociological and philosophical perspectives in my work focussing on decolonial transformation in education. My research interests include land education and settler colonialism and structural racism in schools.

I was a secondary school English and Social Studies teacher for 11 years before pursuing postdoctoral study . Before I was a postdoctoral research fellow for a Marsden project: *He Taonga te Wareware: Remembering and Forgetting New Zealand’s Colonial Past*.
